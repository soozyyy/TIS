<h1>Assignment 3 Reflection</h1>
<p>Attending the virtual talk on UTM Digital was really helpful. I learned how they provide digital services like UTMID and email accounts to make studying easier. They also manage things like networks and data centers. Seeing how each department works showed me how much effort goes into keeping everything running smoothly. It was cool to see how technology is used to improve learning at UTM.
