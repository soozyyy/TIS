<h1>Assignment 1 Reflection</h1>
<p>Attending NALI 2023 was like going on a super interesting learning adventure! I got to see and learn about all sorts of cool stuff that people are using to teach and learn better.

One thing that really caught my attention was a presentation about using fancy technology called augmented reality (AR) to help high school students learn English. They showed how using AR in the classroom can make learning more fun and help students remember more words. Talking to the person running the booth helped me understand even more about how AR can make learning awesome.

I'm studying Computer Science with a focus on making cool graphics and stuff. At NALI, I also found out about virtual reality (VR) being used in education. VR is like stepping into a different world through special goggles. Learning about how VR is being used to teach made me realize how fun and exciting learning can be!

Being at NALI 2023 made me see how technology is changing education for the better. It got me excited about learning and exploring new ways to teach and learn with cool gadgets.
