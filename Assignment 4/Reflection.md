<h1>Assignment 4 Reflection</h1>
<p>Attending Ms. Qistina Batrisyia's industrial talk was super informative. I learned a lot about Credence's system development, technology, and workplace culture. The speaker also talked about careers in analytics like business analyst and data engineer. It was really cool to learn about all these different aspects of the industry.</p>
