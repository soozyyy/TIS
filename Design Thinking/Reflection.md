<h1>Design Thinking Reflection</h1>
<p>Reflecting on my journey in programming, my initial goal was to graduate with a good understanding of coding, sparked by my love for games. But as I learned about design thinking, everything changed. It taught me to solve real problems and be creative.

Now, I see continuous learning and practical experience as vital. I want to keep growing my skills through training and real projects, like internships. By staying connected and working hard, I believe I can make a difference in the programming world.
